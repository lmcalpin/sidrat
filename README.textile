This is intended to eventually become my implementation of a recording debugger, also known as a 'time travelling debugger'.

The idea is to record every method invocation, as well as all field and Object instantiation and assignments, so you can replay
the recording later.  Because you would be simply reviewing a recording, you can jump around 'in time' to see how fields and
variables change over time; you could debug a system on a machine that can't access databases or other external systems that
the application is dependent on.

This system can record and replay events at and supports local variable tracking, but it's pretty far from being complete.

If you are interested in the concept, look at the "Omniscient Debugger":http://www.lambdacs.com/debugger/.  I don't intend to 
implement my debugger in quite the same way, but the idea is similar.
